## Objective:

Learn how to create your own MCP server using FastMCP to share tools with AI agents.

## 4.1 Introduction to FastMCP

`FastMCP` is a Python framework that makes building MCP servers a breeze. Think of it as a helpful assistant that takes care of the tricky protocol details, so you can focus on creating cool tools for your AI agents. `FastMCP` sets up the server to share these with any MCP-compatible client, like a CAMEL AI agent.

FastMCP is great because it’s lightweight and flexible, letting you define exactly what your server does without wrestling with complex networking code. It’s like setting up a lemonade stand—you decide what’s on the menu, and FastMCP handles the customers.

## 4.2 Creating an MCP Server

To build an MCP server, you use FastMCP’s decorators to turn regular Python functions into tools, resources, or prompts that AI agents can discover and use. It’s as simple as writing a function, adding a decorator, and letting FastMCP do the rest.

Here’s a step-by-step look:

1. **Set Up the Server:** Create a FastMCP server instance with a name.
2. **Define Functions:** Write Python functions for your tools or resources.
3. **Add Decorators:** Use FastMCP decorators to make them MCP-ready.

**Code Example:**

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create a server named "DemoServer"
mcp = FastMCP("DemoServer")

# Define a tool for adding numbers
@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b

# Define a resource for personalized greetings
@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")
def get_greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Get a personalized greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

```

## 4.3 How Decorators Work

Decorators are like labels that tell FastMCP how to use your functions. Here’s what they do:

- `@mcp.tool():` Makes a function a tool for actions like calculations, using docstrings and type hints to define it.
- `@mcp.resource():` Sets up a data source, like a message, accessible via a URI (e.g., greeting://{name}).
- `@mcp.prompt():` Creates a template to guide AI responses, such as for questions or summaries.

**Why Different?**

Unlike traditional toolkits, MCP servers decouple tool logic from the agent, enabling standardized, discoverable access.

## Reflection Question:

#### What custom tool would you build with FastMCP?
