## Guidelines üìù
### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b servers/new-server`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new server'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin servers/new-server`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Adding New Servers

To add new servers to the catalog:

1. Add the server information to either `community.json`, `anthropic.json` or `official.json`
2. Follow the existing structure for consistency
3. The changes will be automatically reflected in the UI

This collaborative approach allows the community to maintain an up-to-date catalog of MCP servers.

## Server Data Structure

The core of this project is the server data stored in JSON files. The application uses two main JSON files to catalog MCP servers:

- `public/servers/anthropic.json`: Contains Anthropic MCP servers
- `public/servers/official.json`: Contains official MCP servers

Each server entry follows this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Server Name",
  "key": "server-key",
  "description": "Description of the server functionality",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@package/server-name"],
  "env": {
    "API_KEY": "{{apiKey@string::Your API key}}"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/org/repo"
}
```

## Deployment

### Using Docker

Build and run the Docker image:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t mcp-hub:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 mcp-hub:latest
```

### Deploying to Vercel
